Welcome to the **CryptoMagic** repository! This powerful Python-based tool is designed for advanced Ethereum address hunting and private key cracking through mnemonic generation. By leveraging multi-threading and cryptographic techniques (BIP-39, BIP-32), CryptoMagic generates private keys, compares them against a list of Ethereum "rich addresses," and attempts to find a match.

## Features

- **Multi-threading Support**: Increase the speed of key generation and matching.
- **Mnemonic Generation**: Generate mnemonic phrases for private key recovery.
- **Rich Address Comparison**: Check generated private keys against a list of wealthy Ethereum addresses.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for ease of use.
- **Open Source**: Contribute to the project or modify it to suit your needs.

## Installation

To get started with CryptoMagic, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Carmoly01/CryptoMagic-BruteForce-Ethereum-PrivateKey-Finder-Mnemonic-Cracker.git
   cd CryptoMagic-BruteForce-Ethereum-PrivateKey-Finder-Mnemonic-Cracker
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher**: This tool requires a modern version of Python.

## Usage

After installation, you can run the tool using the command line. Hereâ€™s a simple command to get started:

```bash
python main.py --mnemonic "your mnemonic phrase here"
```

### Command-Line Options

- `--mnemonic`: Provide your mnemonic phrase.
- `--threads`: Specify the number of threads to use for brute forcing (default is 4).
- `--richlist`: Provide a file containing a list of rich Ethereum addresses to compare against.

## How It Works

CryptoMagic uses advanced cryptographic techniques to generate private keys from mnemonic phrases. The tool follows these steps:

1. **Mnemonic Input**: You provide a mnemonic phrase.
2. **Key Generation**: The tool generates private keys using BIP-39 and BIP-32 standards.
3. **Rich Address Comparison**: Each generated key is checked against a predefined list of wealthy Ethereum addresses.
4. **Match Found**: If a match is found, the tool displays the private key and associated Ethereum address.

This process allows users to explore the potential of recovering lost wallets or finding valuable addresses.
